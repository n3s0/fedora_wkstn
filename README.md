# Fedora Workstation Environment

## Overview

This is an encapsulation of my dot files and configuration for my Fedora Workstation systems. General focus of
this is to make my workstation setup as seemless as possible after the OS is installed. A bulk of the work will
be done through a shell script named ```setup.sh```. I may actually move to Makefiles. I'm not sure at the moment.

More documentation will be written for this soon.
